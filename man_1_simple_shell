.SH SYNOPSIS


.SH DESCRIPTION

	The simple shell is the program that manages the command prompt. It is therefore the program that waits for you to enter commands.


	Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.


	The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.


	The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.


	The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.


	If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.


	Handle errors.
